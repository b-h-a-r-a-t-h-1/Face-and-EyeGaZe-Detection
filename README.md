                                    Face and Eye Gaze Detection â€“ Intelligent Vision System using Python
Developed a real-time gaze tracking system using Python with OpenCV, NumPy, and Pandas for detecting facial landmarks and precisely tracing iris movement.
Implemented Haar Cascade and Dlib-based facial detection to identify eye regions and estimate gaze direction for human-computer interaction (HCI) applications.
The system continuously monitors attention levels, enabling use cases in assistive technologies, e-learning analytics, and fatigue detection.
Optimized frame processing for real-time performance and integrated data logging for gaze behavior analysis and visualization.
